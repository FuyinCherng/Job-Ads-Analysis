# About
Due to the rapid development in Information Technology (IT), knowing what skills are trending in the job market can not only help job seekers equip themselves with proper competencies but also help training and education association improve their training curricula. In this paper, we collected IT job advertisements (job ads) from an online job board and applied methods from natu- ral language processing and trend detection on job titles and job descriptions to identify trending skills. We found that “Cloud Com- puting" is a trending skill for IT job from the results of all analysis. Also, there are more and more job ads that listed the requirement of business skills. In addition to investigating trending skills in the context of job ads, we also inserted these skills into Google Trends to see whether these skills are also trendy in the context of the public’s interests. The comparison between Google Trends and job ads shows that a trend in the job market is not necessarily considered as a trend in the public’s interests. We believe that our pipeline of how to analyze job ads can help the subsequent studies to better process the job ads and detect trending jobs and skills. The mismatch between Google Trends and job ads also shows the information gap between what people think the companies require and what the companies actually want.

# Summary
In this paper, we collected over 150,000 job ads of IT job market that were posted in the online job board. We used the standard procedure of Natural Language Processing to clean texts in job ads. Using the cleaned job ads, we extracted skill terms by build n-grams model and the prede ned list of skills. We calculated the frequency and TF-IDF of each n-gram, and by observing how these values change over time, we identi ed several trending words and skills in current IT job market. Furthermore, we also investigated whether people are aware of these trending skills in the job market by looking the Google Trends data of these skills. We found that some skills are trending in both job market and Google Trends, like DevOps and SWA, while some skills performed di erently in Google Trends and job ads, like Microsoft and AMP. We believe that these  ndings give us a good starting point to investigate structural unemployment from the perspective of data mining. In the end, we plan to continue collecting online job ads to re ne the current dataset and to strengthen the current  ndings. After we collect a larger set of job ads, we would like to apply methods from time series analysis and forecasting to identify trending skills from historical information.
