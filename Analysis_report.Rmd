# Summary
In this paper, we collected over 150,000 job ads of IT job market that were posted in the online job board. We used the standard procedure of Natural Language Processing to clean texts in job ads. Using the cleaned job ads, we extracted skill terms by build n-grams model and the prede ned list of skills. We calculated the frequency and TF-IDF of each n-gram, and by observing how these values change over time, we identi ed several trending words and skills in current IT job market. Furthermore, we also investigated whether people are aware of these trending skills in the job market by looking the Google Trends data of these skills. We found that some skills are trending in both job market and Google Trends, like DevOps and SWA, while some skills performed di erently in Google Trends and job ads, like Microsoft and AMP. We believe that these  ndings give us a good starting point to investigate structural unemployment from the perspective of data mining. In the end, we plan to continue collecting online job ads to re ne the current dataset and to strengthen the current  ndings. After we collect a larger set of job ads, we would like to apply methods from time series analysis and forecasting to identify trending skills from historical information.
